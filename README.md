# PI approximation with a Monte-Carlo simulation

The goal of this project is to approximate PI value using a Monte-Carlo simulation.
Every step of the simulation is graphically represented by a raw Portable Pixmap image and generates an animated one at the end of the execution.

This work was done as part of the Basic of Imperative Programming project in the first year of engineering courses at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, UGA.
